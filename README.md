# Algorithm Visualisation Prototype

This is a very basic prototype of the Algorithm visualizations I am hoping to do. The only algorithm implemented here is Bubble sort. 
The main purpose of this build was to showcase the functionality of the app. The User Interface will be improved in other iterations of the app.
Pygame is used because of the simplicity of making the visualization.
I am currently in the process of implementing the descending functionality.
