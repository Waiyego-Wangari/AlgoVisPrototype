# Algorithm Visualisation Prototype

This is a very basic prototype of the Algorithm visualizations I am hoping to do. Th only algorithm implemented here is Bubble sort. 
Pygame is used because of the simplicity of making the visualization.
I am currently in the process of implementing the descending functionality.
